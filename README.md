# Frequentist Inference Case Study

## Overview

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that form a comprehensive case study on Frequentist inference. The case study is divided into two parts:

- **Part A**: Focuses on the foundational concepts of Frequentist inference, including probability distributions, the Central Limit Theorem, and confidence intervals.
- **Part B**: Delves into hypothesis testing, including t-tests, p-values, and the interpretation of results in the context of Frequentist inference.

The aim of this case study is to apply Frequentist statistical techniques to real-world data, enabling the user to draw meaningful inferences and conclusions.

## Objectives

- Understand and apply the principles of Frequentist inference.
- Calculate and interpret confidence intervals.
- Conduct hypothesis testing and understand the significance of p-values.
- Develop a solid foundation in statistical reasoning that can be applied in various data analysis contexts.

## Prerequisites

Before running these notebooks, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

You can install these packages using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas jupyterlab
```

Or with conda, if you're using Anaconda or Miniconda:

```sh
conda install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas jupyterlab
```

## Running the Notebooks

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository folder.
3. Start JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:

```sh
jupyter lab
```
Or:

```sh
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open `Frequentist Inference Case Study - Part A.ipynb` to start with Part A of the case study.
5. After completing Part A, proceed to `Frequentist Inference Case Study - Part B.ipynb` for the continuation.
